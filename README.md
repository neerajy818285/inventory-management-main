# MERN Stack Inventory Management App

## About this project

This project is a full-stack project developed for users to manage their product inventory. In this project, users can store the products they have, enter orders for products that will arrive or leave at a later date, and share inventory access with each other.

I handled both the design and development process together and used technologies like MUI, Headless UI, Framer Motion, Redux Toolkit and React and Zustand in the front-end.
